Feature: Regular expressions
  As a Cucumber student
  I want to learn how to use regular expressions
  So I can match my steps more intelligently

  Scenario: Integer matching
    Given I have an empty basket
    When I put 3 apples in my basket
    And I put 4 apples in my basket
    Then I have 7 apples in my basket

  Scenario: Values from a list
    Given I am a collector of flags
    When I create a collection of flags from the Benelux countries
    Then I should add a flag from The Netherlands
    And I should add a flag from Belgium
    And I should add a flag from Luxembourg

  Scenario: Optional characters
    Given I have an empty fruit bowl
    When I throw in an apple
    And I throw in a banana
    And I throw in a pear
    Then I have a filled fruit bowl
